# Gaussian Prime Spiral
It is a program where I am using Python Turtle library to draw the gaussian prime spiral.
Gaussian primes are of the form x + iy which follow certain limitations. They are :-

1. If either x or y is zero and the other is of the form (4n+3), then it is a gaussian prime
2. If both a and b is non zero and (a^2 + b^2) is a prime number which is not of the form 4n+3. Then it is also a gaussian prime

If we encounter a gaussian prime the turtle turns left. Otherwise it continues straight.
